# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true 
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

### Redundants
- subordinate to bool mapping in hierarchy struct
- subordinate array in hierarchy struct

### Wrinkles 
- create a sub hierarchy
- array in hierarchy cannot call pop function once the hierarchy is set to memory

### Voting is done over these functions;

- create Hierarchy
- modify Hierarchy
