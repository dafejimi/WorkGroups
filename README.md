# WorkGroups
Welcome to WorkGroups! This decentralized application (dApp) is designed to help organizations efficiently manage and track roles and responsibilities within their teams. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, this dApp provides transparency, security, and immutability to ensure the integrity of organizational structures.

## Features

- **Decentralized Architecture:** The application is built on a decentralized network, ensuring data integrity and removing the need for a central authority.

- **Smart Contracts:** Smart contracts are utilized to define roles, responsibilities, and permissions, allowing for automated execution and enforcement of organizational rules.

- **Role Creation and Assignment:** Users can create custom roles and assign them to individuals or groups, specifying their responsibilities, privileges, and limitations.

- **Task Tracking:** The dApp enables tracking of responsibilities assigned to each role, ensuring clear accountability and helping organizations distribute tasks effectively.

- **Immutable Audit Trail:** All changes to roles and responsibilities are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and tamper-proof audit trail for accountability and compliance purposes.
